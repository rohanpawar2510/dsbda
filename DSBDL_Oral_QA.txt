22. Q: What are tools used for data visualization?
   A: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI.

23. Q: What is data wrangling?
   A: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis.

24. Q: What is data transformation?
   A: Changing data format, structure, or values (e.g., normalization, scaling).

25. Q: What is the use of StandardScaler function in Python?
   A: It scales features to have zero mean and unit variance.

27. Q: What is HDFS and MapReduce?
   A: HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System; MapReduce: programming model for processing data.

28. Q: What are the components of Hadoop ecosystem?
   A: HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, Hive, Pig, HBase.

29. Q: What is Scala?
   A: A programming language combining object-oriented and functional programming, runs on JVM.

30. Q: What are features of Scala?
   A: Concise syntax, functional programming, strong static typing, Java interoperability.

31. Q: How is Scala different from Java?
   A: Scala is more concise, supports functional programming, has better type inference.

32. Q: List applications of Scala.
   A: Data processing (with Spark), web development, backend systems.

33. Q: What is data science?
   A: The process of extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

34. Q: What is big data?
   A: Large, complex datasets that traditional tools cannot handle.

35. Q: What are characteristics of big data?
   A: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value.

36. Q: List phases in data science life cycle.
   A: Data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, evaluation, deployment.

37. Q: What is central tendency?
   A: Measures like mean, median, mode that describe the center of data.

38. Q: What is dispersion?
   A: Measures like variance, standard deviation, range that describe data spread.
